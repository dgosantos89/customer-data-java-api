# Security Test Plan

## Objective

Ensure the API is secure from unauthorized access, identify potential security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for mitigation strategies

## Test Cases
1. Injection vulnerabilities by injecting malicious input data.
2. Weak authentication mechanisms such as weak passwords
3. Intercept and decrypt token
4. Accessing endpoints without the correct authorization
5. Verify that unnecessary services and open ports
6. Check for components with known vulnerabilities (e.g outdated libraries)
7. Monitoring sensitive information logs

## Mitigation Strategies
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential weaknesses.
